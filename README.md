Do you have a version of the program that just gets an image and prints it (without the discord bot bit). I would like to try this out with my own game boy printer!

Not really, but all the code is pretty self explanetary
In main it saves the image as image.png
so just add your own image
Then if call ImageProcessing.process_image("image,png")
Which dithers one and saves it as "dithered.png"
Then if you just call printImage in serialCommunication it will just do it
(hopefully)
